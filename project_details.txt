# Correct DHE-RSA flow should be:

1. Initial Connection (what we have now):
   - Exchange RSA public keys for identity verification

2. DH Key Exchange:
   - Generate DH parameters and public value
   - Sign DH public value with our RSA private key
   - Send both DH public value and signature to peer
   - Verify peer's DH value using their RSA public key
   - Generate shared secret using DH

3. Verification:
   - Use the DH shared secret for secure communication
   - Use RSA signatures only for verifying DH parameters

**CISC 468: Cryptography**  
**Course Project Description**  

**Winter 2025**  

This handout outlines the separate requirements for the CISC 468 and CISC 878 course projects.  

### **CISC 468: P2P Secure File Sharing Application**  
CISC 468 projects will design and implement a peer-to-peer secure file sharing application. Each project should be completed in groups of two and should consist of two clients written in two different programming languages, such as Python, Java, Rust, or Go. The clients should be able to communicate with each other despite being implemented with different cryptographic APIs in two different languages. The application must:  

1. Support peer discovery on a local network. A simple protocol that can be used for peer discovery on
a local network is mDNS. On the Internet, a more sophisticated protocol such as BitTorrent would be
required
2. Support mutual authentication of contacts. In other words, after key verification has been performed,
each individual user should be assured of the identity of the user who they are communicating with.
3. Peers should be able to request files from each other, or send a file to another peer; the peer receiving
a request or receiving a file should consent before the request is processed.
4. Peers should be able to request a list of files available to be shared by each other (consent is not
required).
5. If a peer A is offline, but peer B already had peer A’s list of available files, peer B may find another
peer C that had previously downloaded the file from peer A, and request the file from them instead.
But peer B must be able to verify that the file has not been tampered with (i.e., that it is the same
file that peer A was offering) 
6. Allow users to migrate to a new key if their old one is compromised. Existing contacts should be
notified, in this case, and any necessary steps should be taken to re-establish authenticated and secure
communication.  
7. Guarantee the confidentiality and integrity of any files that are sent between users
8. **Support perfect forward secrecy**, preventing past communication decryption if a long-term secret is compromised.  
9. Securely store files on the local client device, so that an attacker who steals the device should not be
able to read them.
10. Display an appropriate message to the user if any error occurs (e.g., if a file cannot be delivered) or a
security check fails (e.g., if a file has been tampered with in transit). Your repository must contain
test cases to check for such relevant scenarios.

### **Deliverables**  
The project accounts for **25% of the final grade** and consists of:  

- **Proposals (5%)** – Due **Feb. 25, 2025**.  
  - CISC 468: Indicate team members and programming languages.

- **Presentations (10%)** – Format and dates **TBA**, held in the last 1-2 weeks of class.  

- **Report & Implementation (85%)** – Final report (in **LaTeX using ACM template**) and GitHub repository submission.  
  - CISC 468: Explain application design, security guarantees, and communication protocol.   
  - Reports must be clear, concise, professional, and free of plagiarism. **Up to 20% of marks may be deducted for poor clarity, grammar, or formatting.**
